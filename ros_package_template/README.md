# Mission Planning Package

## Description

This module starts with the planning layer which contains task manager, it sends next mission to be executed to the execution layer based on the labeled camera feed, in the execution layer the task controller takes input (from task manager) the next mission to be executed and the task feedback ( from task failure handler which takes its readings from sensor fusion), then splits the mission to primitive tasks in correct order to stack them in the scheduler, the scheduler  sends tasks id to global planner to start execution and also task scheduler sends task id to task failure handler for monitoring the mission execution, the feedback handler takes input (from scheduler) the current executing mission ID to help knowing what feedback threshold to expect and which sensors to get its readings from, then sends feedback on each task to task controller and the task controller provide a general feedback from several tasks connected to the same mission and send this general feedback to task manager to be able to log the status in log file, here we have two cases one in case of success therefore there is nothing to be done, and two in case of failure, the task manager decides to redo the mission with a number of attempts and it may also delete the mission and its dependent mission from the scheduler.

## Installation
### Installation from Packages

Open a terminal, clone the repository
~~~
	cd ~/ros2_ws/ #use your current ros2 workspace folder
	git clone https://github.com/VorteX-co/VAUV.git
~~~   

### Building from Source

#### Dependencies

- [Colcon](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Colcon-Tutorial/)
~~~
	sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
~~~ 
- [Robot Operating System (ROS2)](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Eloquent/Linux-Install-Debians/) (Install Eloquent as Debian Package).

#### Building

To build from source, clone the latest version from this repository into your workspace and compile the package using 
~~~
	cd ~/ros2_ws/VAUV/Software/vortex_ws/src/mission_planning/src/
	source /opt/ros/eloquent/setup.bash
	colcon build --symlink-install
~~~

## Usage

First go to project location and source
~~~
	cd ~/ros2_ws/VAUV/Software/vortex_ws/src/mission_planning/src/
	source install/setup.bash
~~~
Then we can start node by node with
~~~
	ros2 run mission_planning class_name
~~~
or launch file with
~~~
	ros2 launch mission_planning launch_file_name.launch.py
~~~

### task_controller_node

Maps each mission id to a corresponding finite state machine, Loops on each current state in the FSM until this state changes based on the feedback from the task failure handler until the FSM is finished and another one takes its place.
